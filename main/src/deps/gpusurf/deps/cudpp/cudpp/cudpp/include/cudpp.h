 * @brief Main library header file.  Defines public interface.
 *
 * The CUDPP public interface is a C-only interface to enable 
 * linking with code written in other languages (e.g. C, C++, 
 * and Fortran).  While the internals of CUDPP are not limited 
 * to C (C++ features are used), the public interface is 
 * entirely C (thus it is declared "extern C").

 * \section introduction Introduction
 * 
 * CUDPP is the CUDA Data Parallel Primitives Library. CUDPP is a
 * library of data-parallel algorithm primitives such as 
 * parallel-prefix-sum ("scan"), parallel sort and parallel reduction. 
 * Primitives such as these are important building blocks for a wide 
 * variety of data-parallel algorithms, including sorting, stream 
 * compaction, and building data structures such as trees and 
 * summed-area tables.
 *
 * \section overview Overview Presentation
 * 
 * A brief set of slides that describe the features, design principles,
 * applications and impact of CUDPP is available here:
 * <a href="http://cudpp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cudpp/doc/CUDPP_slides.pdf">CUDPP Presentation</a>.

 * 
 * \section getting-started Getting Started with CUDPP
 *
 * You may want to start by browsing the \link publicInterface CUDPP Public 
 * Interface\endlink. For information on building CUDPP, see 
 * \ref building-cudpp "Building CUDPP".
 *
 * The "apps" subdirectory included with CUDPP has a few source code samples 
 * that use CUDPP:
 * - \ref example_simpleCUDPP "simpleCUDPP", a simple example of using 
 * cudppScan()
 * - satGL, an example of using cudppMultiScan() to generate a summed-area 
 * table (SAT) of a scene rendered in real time.  The SAT is then used to simulate 
 * depth of field blur.
 * - cudpp_testrig, a comprehensive test application for all the functionality 
 * of CUDPP
 *
 * We have also provided a code walkthrough of the 
 * \ref example_simpleCUDPP "simpleCUDPP" example.
 *
 * \section getting-help Getting Help and Reporting Problems

 *
 * \section release-notes Release Notes
 *
 * For specific release details see the \ref changelog "Change Log".
 *
 * This release (1.1.1) is a bugfix release to CUDPP 1.1 that includes
 * fixes to support CUDA 3.0 and the new NVIDIA Fermi architecture, 
 * including GeForce 400 series and Tesla 20 series GPUs.  It also has
 * bug fixes for 64-bit OSes.
 * 
 * \section opSys Operating System Support
 * 
 * This release (1.1.1) has been thoroughly tested on the following OSes.
 * - Windows XP (32-bit) (CUDA 2.2, 3.0)
 * - Windows 7 (64-bit) (CUDA 3.0)
 * - Redhat Enterprise Linux 5 (64-bit) (CUDA 3.0)
 * - and Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard, 64-bit) (CUDA 3.0)
 *
 * We expect CUDPP to build and run correctly on other flavors of Linux 
 * and Windows, but these are not actively tested by the developers at 
 * this time.
 *
 * Notes: CUDPP is not compatible with CUDA 2.1.  A compiler bug in 2.1 
 * causes the compiler to crash.  Also, starting with CUDPP 1.1.1, we are 
 * no longer testing CUDA device emulation, because it is deprecated in 
 * CUDA 3.0 and will be removed from future CUDA versions.  
 *
 * \section cuda CUDA
 * CUDPP is implemented in
 * <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda">CUDA C/C++</a>. It requires the 
 * CUDA Toolkit version 2.2 or later.  Please see the NVIDIA 
 * <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda">CUDA</a> homepage to download 
 * CUDA as well as the CUDA Programming Guide and CUDA SDK, which includes many 
 * CUDA code examples.  Some of the samples in the CUDA SDK (including 
 * "marchingCubes", "lineOfSight", and radixSort) also use CUDPP.
 *
 * \section design-goals Design Goals
 * Design goals for CUDPP include:
 * 
 * - Performance. We aim to provide best-of-class performance for our
 *   primitives. We welcome suggestions and contributions that will improve 
 *   CUDPP performance. We also want to provide primitives that can be easily 
 *   benchmarked, and compared against other implementations on GPUs and other 
 *   processors.
 * - Modularity. We want our primitives to be easily included in other
 *   applications. To that end we have made the following design decisions:
 *   - CUDPP is provided as a library that can link against other applications. 
 *   - CUDPP calls run on the GPU on GPU data. Thus they can be used
 *     as standalone calls on the GPU (on GPU data initialized by the 
 *     calling application) and, more importantly, as GPU components in larger 
 *     CPU/GPU applications.
 *   - CUDPP is implemented as 4 layers:
 *     -# The \link publicInterface Public Interface\endlink is the external 
 *        library interface, which is the intended entry point for most 
 *        applications. The public interface calls into the 
 *        \link cudpp_app Application-Level API\endlink.
 *     -# The \link cudpp_app Application-Level API\endlink comprises functions
 *        callable from CPU code. These functions execute code jointly on the 
 *        CPU (host) and the GPU by calling into the 
 *        \link cudpp_kernel Kernel-Level API\endlink below them.
 *     -# The \link cudpp_kernel Kernel-Level API\endlink comprises functions
 *        that run entirely on the GPU across an entire grid of thread blocks.  
 *        These functions may call into the \link cudpp_cta CTA-Level API\endlink 
 *        below them.
 *     -# The \link cudpp_cta CTA-Level API\endlink comprises functions that run 
 *        entirely on the GPU within a single Cooperative Thread Array (CTA, 
 *        aka thread block). These are low-level functions that implement core 
 *        data-parallel algorithms, typically by processing data within shared 
 *        (CUDA \c __shared__) memory.
 *
 * Programmers may use any of the lower three CUDPP layers in their own 
 * programs by building the source directly into their application.  However, 
 * the typical usage of CUDPP is to link to the library and invoke functions in 
 * the CUDPP \link publicInterface Public Interface\endlink, as in the 
 * \ref example_simpleCUDPP "simpleCUDPP", satGL, and cudpp_testrig application 
 * examples included in the CUDPP distribution.
 *
 * In the future, if and when CUDA supports building device-level libraries, we 
 * hope to enhance CUDPP to ease the use of CUDPP internal algorithms at all 
 * levels.
 *
 * \subsection uses Use Cases
 * We expect the normal use of CUDPP will be in one of two ways:
 * -# Linking the CUDPP library against another application. 
 * -# Running our "test" application, cudpp_testrig, that exercises
 *   CUDPP functionality.

 * \section citing Citing CUDPP
 *
 * If you make use of CUDPP primitives in your work and want to cite
 * CUDPP (thanks!), we would prefer for you to cite the appropriate 
 * papers above, since they form the core of CUDPP. To be more specific, 
 * the GPU Gems paper describes (unsegmented) scan, multi-scan for 
 * summed-area tables, and stream compaction. The NVIDIA technical report 
 * describes the current scan and segmented scan algorithms used in the 
 * library, and the Graphics Hardware paper describes an earlier 
 * implementation of segmented scan, quicksort, and sparse matrix-vector 
 * multiply. The IPDPS paper describes the radix sort used in CUDPP, and 
 * the I3D paper describes the random number generation algorithm.

/**
 * @page building-cudpp Building CUDPP
 *
 * CUDPP has currently been tested in Windows XP, Windows Vista, Mac OS X 
 * and Linux.  See \ref release-notes for release specific platform support.
 *
 * \section build-win32 Building CUDPP on Windows XP
 *
 * CUDPP can be built using either or MSVC 8 (2005) or MSVC 9 (2008).  To 
 * build, open cudpp/cudpp.sln. Then you can build the library 
 * using the "build" command as you would with any other workspace. There are 
 * four configurations: debug, release, emudebug, and emurelease.  The first 
 * two are self-explanatory.  The second two are built to use CUDA device 
 * emulation, meaning they will be run (slowly) on the CPU.
 *
 * \section build-linux Building CUDPP on Linux and Mac OS X
 *
 * CUDPP can be built using standard g++ and Make tools on Linux, by typing 
 * "make" in the "cudpp/" subdirectory.  Before building CUDPP, you should 
 * first build the CUDA Utility Library (libcutil) by typing "make; make dbg=1" 
 * in the "common/" subdirectory.  This will generate libcutil.a and 
 * libcutilD.a.  
 * 
 * The makefile for CUDPP and all sample applications take the optional 
 * arguments "emu=1" and "dbg=1".  The former builds CUDPP for device emulation,
 * and the latter for debugging. The two flags can be combined. "verbose=1"
 * can be used to see all compiler output.
 *
 * \section build-apps Building CUDPP Sample Applications
 * 
 * The sample applications in the "apps/" subdirectory can be built exactly 
 * like CUDPP is--either by opening the appropriate .sln/.vcproj file in MSVC 
 * in Windows, or using "make" in Linux.
 *
 * On some Linux installations you will get linker errors relating to "-lXi"
 * and "-lXmu".  To fix this, you will need to install libXi and libXmu.  On 
 * Debian and Ubuntu, for example, you can simply run 
 *  "sudo apt-get install libxi-dev", and 
 *  "sudo apt-get install libxmu-dev"
 *
