## Obstacle duration priors (seconds).
##
## This file is consumed by vtr_navigation when:
##   route_planning.obstacle_costs.source = "file"
##
## Notes
## - Values are expected blockage durations used for rerouting decisions.
## - The Navigator treats the newest detection as authoritative (overwrite),
##   i.e., if an edge is re-detected with a different type later, the new type's
##   duration fully replaces the previous blockage estimate for that edge.

default: 60.0
obstacles:
  person: 0.0
  human: 0.0
  chair: 6000.0
